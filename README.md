# macroboard-ahk
In some apps you cant bind F13 or you cant bind any keys so i made a ahk script that helps you with binding things :3
# Â¿How can i start it every time i turn on my pc?
It is pretty easy, you just need to open the run command with Win + R

Then you just put shell:startup

now you just need to put the compiled version of your ahk and use your macroboard :p
